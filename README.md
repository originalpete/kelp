# Kelp

Uses anime.js to turn SVG into soothing kelp motion. Open index.html to view, or [take a look on CodePen](https://codepen.io/originalpete/pen/xxVzNgd).

Caveats:

* Only tested in Chrome desktop (OSX) and mobile Safari. Probably doesn't work in all browsers.
* Used a couple cheats in anime.js - e.g. using "reverse" to animate both sides of the motion instead of separate up/down. This means that you can't control timing of up/down separately. Also means that delays act on both ends of the cycle which isn't ideal.
